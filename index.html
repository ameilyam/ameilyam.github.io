          <p class="about-me-text">
            Hello! I am Ameilya Monson, a recent computer science graduate from Brigham Young University. I am a detail-oriented and highly motivated individual 
            with a strong academic background, achieving cum laude honors, and a genuine passion for software development. My focus is on leveraging technical expertise, 
            problem-solving abilities, and collaborative skills to contribute to innovative software solutions.
          </p>
          <p class="about-me-text">
            I started programming as a senior high school when I was taking early college classes from Weber State University from which I earned an Associate of Science 
            degree at the same time as I graduated from high school.  I then started at BYU in fall 2019, and having already completed my general education I jumped right
             into the computer science major. After my first year, I served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Laie, Hawaii and 
             Manchester England.  I returned home to start my final year at BYU in the summer of 2022 before graduating in Spring 2023.  
          </p>
          <p class="about-me-text">
            During my final year I had the opportunity to work as a teacher’s assistant for a class called Software Engineering in the Real World where I had the 
            opportunity to act as manager for 12 different student software projects.  During this time, I got to improve my professional and problem-solving skills
             to keep these groups running smoothly and ensure they met all of their deadlines and produced a working project by the end of the semester. 
          </p>
          <p class="about-me-text">
            I also worked as a research assistant for BYU’s Social Technology and Privacy Lab (STaPL).  In this position I got to work collaboratively with many other 
            researchers and professors in discussing many issues surrounding privacy and social media.  I worked specifically on the lab’s Autism and Social media team
             creating prototypes of various features that could be added to social media platforms such as Facebook and Facebook Messenger that would create a safer 
             and more accessible environment for adults with autism. These projects include making web extensions and react apps, as well as utilizing natural-language 
             processing models.
          </p>
          <p class="about-me-text">
            Through these positions and the projects, I worked on through my schooling I have become proficient in many programming languages including Java, Python, 
            C, C++, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  I’ve also learned to use many technologies such as React, Git, Android development, and many AWS services.  I am highly 
            teachable, eager to learn, and I have a passion for programming.  I am excited for any new opportunities to learn, grow, and make a difference as a programmer!
